# Gale-Shapley-for-The-Hospitals-Residents-Problem
The Hospitals / Residents Problem - Gale/Shapley algorithm for HR
Marriage problem (SM; see Entries 142 and 143), which is a special case of HR in which
n = m, A = R × H, and cj = 1 for all hj ∈ H – in this case, the residents and hospitals
are more commonly referred to as the men and women respectively. Gale and Shapley
show that every instance I of HR admits at least one stable matching. Their proof of this
result is constructive, i.e., an algorithm for finding a stable matching in I is described.
This algorithm has become known as the Gale/Shapley algorithm.
